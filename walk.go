// "dir/a". The info argument is the FileInfo for the named path.

// If there was a problem walking to the file or directory named by path, the
// incoming error will describe the problem and the function can decide how
// to handle that error (and Walk will not descend into that directory). In the

// processing stops. The sole exception is when the function returns the special
// value SkipDir. If the function returns SkipDir when invoked on a directory,
// Walk skips the directory's contents entirely. If the function returns SkipDir
// when invoked on a non-directory file, Walk skips the remaining files in the
